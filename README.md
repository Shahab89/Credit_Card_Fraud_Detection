# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced neural network and deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a robust model capable of accurately identifying fraudulent activities to protect both consumers and financial institutions from potential losses.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains anonymized credit card transactions, with each transaction labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing only a small fraction of the total.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Applied feature scaling and normalization to standardize the input data.

### Neural Network Architecture
- Designed a multi-layer neural network with multiple hidden layers to capture complex patterns in the data.
- Implemented activation functions, including ReLU and sigmoid, to introduce non-linearity.
- Utilized dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

### Deep Learning Techniques
- Implemented techniques like batch normalization and early stopping to optimize model performance.

### Model Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model.
- Used metrics such as precision, recall, and prc to assess the model's performance.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance further.

## Results
- Achieved a high accuracy rate in identifying fraudulent transactions, with a precision of over 90% and recall above 90%.
- The model demonstrated robust performance in handling imbalanced data, effectively minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the effectiveness of neural networks and deep learning techniques in detecting credit card fraud. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and thorough data analysis, we can build reliable fraud detection systems that offer enhanced security and peace of mind for both consumers and financial institutions.
